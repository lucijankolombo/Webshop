      <h1>About us</h1>
      <p class="param">Apple Inc. is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Cupertino, California, 
      that designs, develops and sells consumer electronics, computer software, and online services. 
      It is considered one of the Big Tech technology companies, alongside Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Facebook.
      Apple's worldwide annual revenue totaled $274.5 billion for the 2020 fiscal year. 
      Apple is the world's largest technology company by revenue and one of the world's most valuable companies. 
      It is also the world's third-largest mobile phone manufacturer after Samsung and Huawei.
      <span id="more">In August 2018, Apple became the first publicly traded U.S. company to be valued at over $1 trillion and just two years later in August 2020 became the first $2 trillion U.S. company.
      The company employs 137,000 full-time employees and maintains 510 retail stores in 25 countries as of 2020.
      It operates the iTunes Store, which is the world's largest music retailer. 
      As of January 2020, more than 1.5 billion Apple products are actively in use worldwide. 
      The company also has a high level of brand loyalty and is ranked as the world's most valuable brand. 
      However, Apple receives significant criticism regarding the labor practices of its contractors, its environmental practices and unethical business practices, including anti-competitive behavior, as well as the origins of source materials.
